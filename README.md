#  Drawing

This project has some examples of drawind shapes in SwiftUI

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Create custom paths with SwiftUI
- Add strokeBorder() support with InsettableShape
- Transform shapes using CGAffineTransform and even-odd fills
- Create borders and fills using ImagePaint
- Enable high-performance Metal rendering with drawingGroup()

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
